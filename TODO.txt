General TODO list for Earvision

TRAIN

-	box_iou is not working with full dataset (Trainer.py, function train()); works with sample dataset -> need to fix
-	develop hyperparameter search function
	->	data output and saving
	-> 	can I use gridsearch? or would it be better to do it manually?
	->	what can I cut from Train to help speed up the process 
	->	I want to do this on the whole dataset, but it may be better to split male and female?


INFERENCE

-	run inference on male dataset with 0306 model
-	rerun inference on female dataset with 0306 model?
-	record and compare stats for John
